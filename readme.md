## Installation

Hermes is built using rust. To install it, run the following:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/imvaskel/hermes
```

This will compile the program and place it into your cargo installation directory.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled via a file. Hermes checks for a file called ``config.ron`` in the working directory. You find a template <a href="/config.template.ron">here.</a>

## Usage

After configuration is done, you can navigate to the local url to view the page. You can register an account with your registration key and then start using the app.
